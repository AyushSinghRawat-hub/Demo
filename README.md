## Welcome to my portfolio website!
This page offers a summary of my qualifications and recent work while also showcasing some of it.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create this website. With a responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes, the layout is intended to be clear and simple to use. The top of the page features the website's main menu, which includes links to the Home, About, Portfolio, Skills, and Contact pages.

A brief description of my most recent projects is included on the Home page, along with an introduction to who I am and what I do. More specific information about my history, education, and professional experience is provided on the About page. On the Portfolio page, you can see screenshots and details of some of my most recent projects.
