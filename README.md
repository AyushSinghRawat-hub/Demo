## Welcome to my portfolio website!

The top of the page features the website's main menu, which includes links to the Home, About, Portfolio, Skills, and Contact pages.

A brief description of my most recent projects is included on the Home page, along with an introduction to who I am and what I do. More specific information about my history, education, and professional experience is provided on the About page.
