## Welcome to my portfolio website!
This website showcases some of my recent work and provides an overview of my skills and experience.

This website has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is designed to be clean and easy to navigate, with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The main menu is located at the top of the page, with links to different sections of the website including Home, About, Portfolio, Skills, and Contact.

The Home page provides an introduction to who I am and what I do, along with a brief summary of my recent projects. The About page includes more detailed information about my background, education, and work experience. The Portfolio page showcases some of my recent projects, with screenshots and descriptions of each one. The Skills page provides a list of my technical skills and areas of expertise. Finally, the Contact page includes a contact form that visitors can use to get in touch with me.

The website also includes some dynamic features built with JavaScript, such as a slideshow on the Home page and an interactive contact form on the Contact page. The CSS styles have been carefully crafted to create a consistent visual style across the website, with attention to typography, color, and spacing.
